*Multiplayer Minecraft Mod*

*July 2011*

Owner is a Minecraft multiplayer mod that allows you to own and share the blocks you build!

I. The idea.
----

I noticed that when you play on a Minecraft server, the players don't have all have the same way to have fun.
Some like to hunt monsters, some like to explore. Some like to build, some like to destroy those buildings!
As the last fact is a big problem, I tried to find an idea that would allow the players to keep their constructions safe from the others players and even from the world.

Some mods already exist. With those, you can define an area where you will be the only one to be able to interact with.
There are several problems with this concept:
- you need to contact an administrator to reserve your area
- your area is not extensible
- if the player doesn't build on this area, it's a waste of land

So I came up with my own simple idea: all the blocks you craft should be yours! This idea solves all the previous problems. 
Indeed, as it's automatic you don't need to ask for the permission and you won't notice it when you play!


II. The features.
---

Block protection:
- The block you own are protected from everything: other players, TNT, creepers, fires, pistons, etc.
- It also protects the blocks under and above the one you built, for several layers. 
- However, the layers at the top and at the bottom of the world cannot be owned so you cannot trap other players.

Trust list:
- You can add your friends to a list so they can interact with your blocks.
- When you connect the server, you can see the list of your connected friends.

Behaviour:
- If you decide the block you craft shouldn't be yours, you can change it.


The data is stored in a MySQL database so you can easily show your server stats on its website :)
